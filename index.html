				<h1 style: aligned:left>About Me</h1>
				Hello there! I am Antonio Coronado, a Technical Game Designer specialized in 
				creating Mechanics and Systems for games. I have always been deeply passionate 
				about video games, particularly open-world, survival and RPGs. Later in my life, 
				I realized that my passion lay in creating games through design. It brings 
				me immense joy to give life to games through interconnected systems that 
				result in a memorable and enjoyable experience for players.
				<br>
				Games such as Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed 1, and Red Dead Redemption 
				have not only been my favorites but also served as a reference in my life as a 
				game designer. 
				These games are proof that creating a video game with passion and well-developed 
				systems can bring a successful product to the market and joy to millions of people.				
				<br><br>
				With almost 2.5 years of experience in the video game industry, I have had the 
				opportunity to work with teams of up to 15 people from various areas and roles 
				including marketing, level design, concept art, programming, 3D art, writing, 
				animation, and sound. This has allowed me to learn from my colleagues and improve 
				my design skills, as well as enhance my communication skills and learn different 
				pipelines.			
				<br><br>
				My dream is to work on a AAA game and help build an amazing title that millions 
				of people can play and have fun with, just as I do.
				<br><br>
				If you're seeking a passionate technical game designer who can create prototypes, 
				complex systems, and mechanics with a high level of commitment to game projects, 
				then look no further! Let's connect and create something amazing together.
