				<h1>About Me</h1>
				Hello! I'm Antonio Coronado a game designer specialized in creating mechanics and 
				systems for games. I always had a huge love for videogames, specially the open world and RPGs. 
				Later in my life I found out a bigger passion, design and create them.
				I enjoy the challenge of giving life to games through systems that connect to each other to
				bring a whole experience to the player. 
				<br>
				Games like Skyrim and the witcher 3 has been a reference in my life (and my favorite games). 
				They are the proof that making a game with passion and good systems can bring a succesful product to the market
				and joy to millions of people.
				<br><br>
				With almost 2.5 years of experience in the videogames industry, I have had the chance to work in teams 
				up to 15 people from different areas and roles like marketing, level design, concept art, programming,
				3D art, writers, animators and sound just to mention a few, allowing me to learn from them to complement my own career 
				path and improve my design skills. Not only that but to enhance my communication skills and learn 
				different pipelines.
				<br><br>
				My dream is to work in a AAA game and help to build an amazing title that millions of people can play
				and have fun just as I do. 
				<br><br>
				If you are looking to hire a passionate game designer with skills creating systems or mechanics and 
				high commitment no matter the size of the game, I am the guy!
				Let's connect.
