				<h1 style: aligned:left>About Me</h1>
				Hi there! I'm Antonio Coronado, a Technical Game Designer who specializes in creating Mechanics and Systems for games. 
				I've always had a huge passion for video games, particularly open world and RPGs, and I realized later in my life that 
				I wanted to create them through design. 
				I find it extremely enjoyable to give life to games through systems that connect to each other, 
				resulting in a fun and unforgettable experience for players.
				<br>
				Games such as Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed 1, and Red Dead Redemption have not only been my favorites but also a 
				design reference in my life. These games serve as proof that creating a videogame with passion and well-developed systems can 
				bring a successful product to the market and joy to millions of people.				
				<br><br>
				With almost 2.5 years of experience in the video game industry, I have had the chance to work with teams of up to 15 people from 
				various areas and roles, including marketing, level design, concept art, programming, 3D art, writing, animation, and sound. 
				This has allowed me to learn from my colleagues and improve my design skills, as well as enhance my communication skills and learn different pipelines.				
				<br><br>
				My dream is to work on a AAA game and help build an amazing title that millions of people can play and have fun with, just as I do.
				<br><br>
				If you're looking for a passionate technical game designer who can create prototypes, complex systems, and mechanics with a high level of commitment to game projects, then I'm your guy! Let's connect and create something amazing together.
