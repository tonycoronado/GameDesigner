						<br>   • Worked hand to hand with 3D artists, level designer and implemented destruction features with blueprints to multiple assets.
   						<br>   • Created an in-editor tool to apply custom LODs to more than 400 assets simultaneously, improving 8-10 FPS in-game with only a few clicks.
   						<br>   • Devised, created and implemented a spawn system to randomize obstacles at the track making the game way more dynamic.
   						<br>   • Created a character selection widget to select skin for the mount and rider.
